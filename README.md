# Regex Matcher

This is a basic regular expression matcher. Features intended to be supported
are:

* character classes
* character literals
* the `.` metacharacter
* `+`, `*`, and `?` multiplicity metacharacters
* `^` and `$` positional metacharacters
* `\` to escape metacharacters

Not intended for immediate support:

* regex OR `|`
* sub-regexes grouped with `(` and `)`
* specifying multiplicity using `{` and `}`
* lookaround
* captures and backreferences
